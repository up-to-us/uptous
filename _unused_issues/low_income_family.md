<strong>MYTH</strong>: Unhoused people are at odds with hard working low income families

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Homeless families are low income families. In fact, millions of families across the country are 1-2 paychecks away from falling into houselessness. In 2020 alone, the number of unhoused families in LA [increased by 45.7%](https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4558-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-presentation.pdf). Thatâ€™s 45.7% more moms, dads, and kids. The majority of those kids are under [12 years old](https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/homeless-children-and-youth). The [trauma](https://www.samhsa.gov/homelessness-programs-resources/hpr-resources/child-homelessness-growing-crisis) of living on the street at that age will have lasting effects on their abilities to thrive.
