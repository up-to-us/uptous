<strong>MYTH</strong>: Homeless people refuse to work.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: [There is not one single state in the US where a full-time minimum wage job provides enough money to pay the average rent](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/full-time-minimum-wage-workers-cant-afford-rent-anywhere-in-the-us.html). Read that again, and let it sink in. There is not one single state in the US where a full-time minimum wage job provides enough money to pay the average rent. It is no secret that [the last 40-50 years have eroded the power of unions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4880254/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20the%20power,union%20membership%20is%20at%2011.3%25.) in the United States. Workers are afraid that if they stand up to exploitative bosses their jobs will be outsourced to another country with cheaper labor costs. The fact is for many people without college degrees, finding a job that pays enough money to make ends meet is extremely difficult. Employers know this and can take advantage by exploiting their workers' situations. Once you become unhoused it is even more difficult to find a good paying job. Unhoused people who work are often coerced into working excessive hours, and sometimes are paid at completely irregular intervals subject to the whim of their boss. For this reason unhoused people and workers often don't disclose their situation - and live in constant fear of being found out.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: [Stand on the side of workers rights](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/our-work/workers-rights#:~:text=freedom%20of%20association%20and%20the,respect%20of%20employment%20and%20occupation.). We must create a robust social safety net. This includes high quality education, opportunities for worker training, child care, child tax credits, medicare for all, universal basic income. Quality of life is so deeply intertwined with having [meaningful, dignified work](https://ftp.iza.org/dp13112.pdf), but when people are financially vulnerable, they are often coerced into staying in unsatisfying, dangerous, low paying jobs that go nowhere. What's more, employment intersects with [racism, gender discrimination](https://www.amacad.org/publication/race-gender-economic-inequality-united-states), [lgbtq+ discrimination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X19300695), ethnic discrimination and more to create a situation in which marginalized groups are less likely in general to be able to make ends meet, further perpetuating inequities. There are a number of organizations in LA dedicated to this work.

Here are a few:

- [LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES](https://lafla.org/get-help/employment/)
- [SCOPE LA](https://scopela.org/our-work/los-angeles-equity-alliance/)
