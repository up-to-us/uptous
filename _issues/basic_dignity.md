<strong>MYTH</strong>: Unhoused people want to live that way, that's why they don't better themselves.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Experiencing houselessness is one of the most difficult and degrading things a person can live through. Cleaning your clothes, getting new shoes, brushing your teeth, getting reliable access to meals or taking a shower all become huge obstacles when you are on the street. What's more, without access to these things it becomes nearly impossible to find or maintain employment.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: There are many ways to help unhoused people maintain a sense of dignity. Sometimes simply befriending someone, learning their name, checking in with them and letting them know you see them is enough. But, there are a number of community led efforts to help unhoused people get access to the things they need while they are on the streets.
