<strong>MYTH</strong>: People experiencing homelessness are usually men.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: 84% of all families experiencing homelessness are headed by women. This is deeply connected to a larger sexist culture that pays women, particularly poor and working class women, 80 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts. Some women may then stay in bad situations because they need to rely on their partners for economic support. Mothers experiencing homelessness are often fleeing abusive domestic partners, and are at higher risk of sexual violence while unhoused.

Though there are many organizations who help unhoused women, the [DOWNTOWN WOMENâ€™S CENTER](https://downtownwomenscenter.org/) is the only organization in LA that focuses exclusively on helping currently or formerly unhoused women.
