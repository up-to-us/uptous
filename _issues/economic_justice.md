<strong>MYTH</strong>: People become unhoused because they are lazy and don’t want to work

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: In LA, approximately 27% of people experiencing homelessness have either part time or full time jobs. The issue for many is that while homeless it is very difficult to find or maintain a job, and for those who do have jobs they aren’t making enough money to pay rent. Wage stagnation, erosion of social safety nets, weakening unions, and trickle down economic policies have left large swaths of the population vulnerable to becoming unhoused. In fact, 1 in 3 renters in Los Angeles is 1 missed paycheck or major life event away from becoming unhoused. This is plainly unacceptable.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: An expanded social safety net that includes increased worker protections, medicare for all, child tax credits, child care, universal basic income, and housing guarantees would go a long way toward eliminating poverty and houselessness. Additionally, transitioning away from a traditional criminal justice approach of policing and prisons towards a preventative care focused approach can go a long way to eliminating poverty and lifting people out of generational cycles of trauma and harm. There are many organizations working toward this in Los Angeles.
