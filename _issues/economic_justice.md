<strong>MYTH</strong>: People become unhoused because they are lazy and donâ€™t want to work

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: In LA, approximately 27% of people experiencing homelessness have either part time or full time jobs. The issue for many is that while homeless it is very difficult to find or maintain a job, and for those who do have jobs they aren't making enough money to pay rent. Wage stagnation, erosion of social safety nets, weakening unions, and trickle down economic policies have left large swaths of the population vulnerable to becoming unhoused. In fact, as many as 59% of Americans are one missed paycheck or major life event away from becoming unhoused. This is plainly unacceptable.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: Expanding and reforming the social safety net, as well as simplifying the one we have would go a long way toward eliminating poverty and houselessness, particularly with housing assistance. Additionally, transitioning away from a traditional criminal justice approach of policing and prisons towards a preventative care focused approach can go a long way to eliminating poverty and lifting people out of generational cycles of trauma and harm. Lastly, single family zoning has done a lot to create this crisis, and abandoning these policies would go a long way to getting us out of it. There are many organizations working toward this in Los Angeles.
