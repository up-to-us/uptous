<strong>MYTH</strong>: People become unhoused because they are lazy and don’t want to work

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: In LA, [approximately 27%](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/30/652572292/working-while-homeless-a-tough-job-for-thousands-of-californians) of people experiencing homelessness have either part time or full time jobs. The issue for many is that while homeless it is very difficult to find or maintain a job, and for those who do have jobs they aren’t making enough money to pay rent. Wage stagnation, erosion of social safety nets, weakening unions, and trickle down economic policies have left large swaths of the population vulnerable to becoming unhoused. In fact, as many as [59% of Americans](https://invisiblepeople.tv/59-of-americans-are-just-one-paycheck-away-from-homelessness/) are one missed paycheck or major life event away from becoming unhoused. This is plainly unacceptable.
