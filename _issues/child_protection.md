<strong>MYTH</strong>: People experiencing homelessness are all adults who make bad choices.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: In LAUSD there are a staggering number of children experiencing homelessness. Estimates range from 17,000 in the city to as high as 63,000 county wide. Nationally, a 2019 survey of US teachers found that there were 1.2 Million unhoused children across the country. That’s just the children. What’s more, transitional age foster children are extremely vulnerable to falling through the cracks. Untreated trauma, lack of social support and financial resources make it difficult for these children to thrive in adulthood.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: There are ways to help! Right now the state of California is expanding their pilot program of Universal Basic Income to foster children across the state. So far [the program](https://imprintnews.org/foster-care/california-approves-first-state-guaranteed-income-for-foster-youth/56957) has been a resounding success. Voice your support. Tell your friends. Get involved with or support local organizations dedicated to getting children off the street.
