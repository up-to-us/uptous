<strong>MYTH</strong>: People experiencing homelessness are all adults who make bad choices.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: In LAUSD there are a staggering number of children experiencing homelessness. Estimates range from [17,000](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-housing-crisis-17000-homeless-children-los-angeles-school-district/) in the city to as high as [63,000](https://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-skid-row-homeless-children-20161124-story.html) county wide. Nationally, [a 2019 survey of US teachers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/opinion/homeless-america-data.html) found that there were 1.2 Million unhoused children across the country. That’s just the children. What’s more, transitional age foster children are extremely vulnerable to falling through the cracks. [20% of foster children will become homeless the day they age out.](https://finallyfamilyhomes.org/the-problem/) Untreated trauma, lack of social support and financial resources make it difficult for these children to thrive in adulthood.
