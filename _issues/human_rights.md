<strong>MYTH</strong>: Homeless people have special rights the rest of us don't have. Beggars can't be choosers, after all.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: While it can seem strange to say that sleeping on the sidewalk is a right, or that unhoused people have the right to control their own health care options- the truth is these are rights we all have. [Becoming unhoused doesn't mean you surrender your rights](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/outsidethelaw-aclufdnsca-report.pdf), it just means you can't afford a place to live at the moment. The [United Nations](https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/housing/pages/homelessnessandhumanrights.aspx#:~:text=Homelessness%20has%20emerged%20as%20a,to%20prevent%20and%20eliminate%20it.) has recognized homelessness as a violation of human rights, because everyone deserves a place to live. Temporary solutions like shelters or tiny homes can be helpful stopgaps in a crisis, but too often they become the focus, rather than finding and creating permanent solutions.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: [Housing is a human right](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/AG-2021/01-06_Housing-Human-Right.pdf). Advocating for equity in housing policy and for solutions that center the voices and needs of unhoused people is key. They are the ones experiencing homelessness, so they are the ones who should determine the best courses of action to get them out of the situation. Too often the solutions are politically expedient band-aids. [There are more empty houses in LA than there are unhoused people](https://reclaimingourhomes.org/). We need access to housing and we need it now. There are several organizations in LA working on this issue.

Here are a few:

- [EVERYONE IN](https://everyoneinla.org/get-involved/)
- [LA ALLIANCE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS](https://www.la-alliance.org/who_we_are)
- [RECLAIMING OUR HOMES](https://reclaimingourhomes.org/)
