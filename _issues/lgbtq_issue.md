<strong>MYTH</strong>: With marriage equality, gay people no longer experience stigmas.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: 40% of LAâ€™s youth identify as LGBTQ+. More broadly, LQBTQ+ people make up 20-40% of the overall unhoused population, meaning they are much more likely than their non-LGBTQ+ counterparts to become unhoused. The stigmas and general ignorance surrounding these issues can contribute greatly to the likelihood someone can become unhoused.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: Many LGBTQ+ people experiencing houselessness have been sexually abused, in foster care, suffer from stigmas surrounding their identity, and/or have difficult and traumatic family experiences. Focusing on solutions that center the needs of these communities, especially on early childhood intervention to prevent the kinds of traumas that can lead issues later in life is key. There are several organizations that focus on helping LGBTQ+ youth.

Here are a few:

- [THE LA LGBT CENTER](https://lalgbtcenter.org/social-service-and-housing/youth/homelessness)
- [TRUE COLORS UNITED (National)](https://truecolorsunited.org/)
- [PFLAG LA](https://pflag.org/chapter/pflag-los-angeles)
