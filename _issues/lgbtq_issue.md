<strong>MYTH</strong>: With marriage equality, gay people no longer experience stigmas.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: [40% of LAâ€™s youth identify as LGBTQ+](https://lacontroller.org/press-releases/l-a-controller-maps-lgbtq-resources-to-connect-homeless-youth-with-services/). More broadly, LGBTQ+ people make up [20-40%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6695950/) of the overall unhoused population, meaning they are much more likely than their cis-hetero peers to become unhoused. The stigma surrounding these issues can contribute greatly to the likelihood someone can become unhoused.
