<strong>MYTH</strong>: Homeless people have special rights the rest of us don’t have. Beggars can’t be choosers, after all.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: While it can seem strange to say that sleeping on the sidewalk is a right, or that unhoused people have the right to control their own health care options- the truth is these are rights we all have. [Becoming unhoused doesn’t mean you surrender your rights](https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/outsidethelaw-aclufdnsca-report.pdf), it just means you can’t afford a place to live at the moment. The [United Nations](https://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/housing/pages/homelessnessandhumanrights.aspx#:~:text=Homelessness%20has%20emerged%20as%20a,to%20prevent%20and%20eliminate%20it.) has recognized homelessness as a violation of human rights, because everyone deserves a place to live. Temporary solutions like shelters or tiny homes can be helpful stopgaps in a crisis, but too often they become the focus, rather than finding and creating permanent solutions.
