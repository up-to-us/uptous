<strong>MYTH</strong>: Unhoused people bring filth and disease and their garbage is unsanitary

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Not only is chronic illness or poor health a cause of houselessness, being unhoused makes health issues worse. Regular access to hygiene, medical care, medications, and sanitation become extremely difficult when you are chronically unhoused. What's more, people living with addictions on the street don't have regular access to clean needles or harm reduction products like NARCAN. These are essential survival tools for those experiencing addiction. It can be easy to judge people suffering from addiction, but the fact is the opioid crisis, meth addiction, these are national epidemics that are devastating communities across the country. It's extremely difficult to buck an addiction, it's nearly impossible when you are living on the street.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: Advocate for regular non-punitive sanitation options at encampments, as well as hygiene options like regular public showers. If you live near an encampment, check in with the people there to see what they need. We need non-judgmental addiction services and comprehensive health care. Get involved with organizations that focus on harm reduction, outreach and providing access to health care. Last but not least, [housing is critical in creating better health outcomes.](https://www.greendoors.org/facts/cost.php) In LA there are many.
