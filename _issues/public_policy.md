<strong>MYTH</strong>: The real problem is we go too easy on these people. They need to be locked up, and forced into addiction treatment or mental health facilities.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Addiction and mental illness as causes of houselessness are often overstated. The biggest reasons are: I can’t afford rent, and not enough income. What’s more, policing the homeless in any given period of time can cost 2-3 times more than simply building permanent housing. In the long run the costs are far greater. When unhoused people are arrested, they are often fined more money than they can afford or spend time in jail where they can be traumatized more. Having been to prison is the #1 predictor of whether or not a person will become unhoused. It also makes it extremely difficult to find a job or permanent housing. This creates a vicious cycle of poverty and houselessness. Adding family dynamics, and generational trauma, and suddenly the long term cost of policing becomes staggeringly more expensive than providing a robust social safety net.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: We need to put the needs of unhoused people first. When we do that, we lift the entire society up, whereas if we focus only on the needs of the broader housed community it’s like lifting a heavy grocery bag from the top, it will rip and the whole society will fall out the bottom. Houselessness, whether we turn our backs on it or not, affects us all. Turning a blind eye to it cuts each and every one of us off from our humanity. This is not natural. We need to set aside a punitive approach and focus on care, compassion, and a robust social safety net. There are several organizations working on this kind of public policy in LA.
