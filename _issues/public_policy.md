<strong>MYTH</strong>: The real problem is we go too easy on these people. They need to be locked up, and forced into addiction treatment or mental health facilities.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: Addiction and mental illness as causes of houselessness are often overstated. The biggest reasons are: I can’t afford rent, and not enough income. What’s more, [policing the homeless is more expensive](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/homeless-shelter-housing-help-solutions) than building permanent housing.. [In the long run the costs are far greater](https://www.hoover.org/research/economics-why-homelessness-worsens-governments-spend-even-more-problem). [When unhoused people are arrested](https://www.urban.org/features/five-charts-explain-homelessness-jail-cycle-and-how-break-it), they are often fined more money than they can afford or spend time in jail where they can be traumatized more. Having been to prison is the #1 predictor of whether or not a person will become unhoused. It also makes it extremely difficult to find a job or permanent housing. This creates a vicious cycle of poverty and houselessness. Adding family dynamics, and generational trauma, and suddenly the [long term cost of policing](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-economic-costs-of-the-u-s-criminal-justice-system/) becomes staggeringly more expensive than providing a robust social safety net.
