<strong>MYTH</strong>: CDisabled people can get all the help they need. There's no legitimate reason they should be living on the streets.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: Living with disabilities - physical, mental, emotional, or otherwise - can shape and reshape every aspect of your life. Everything from getting to the grocery store, to taking a bath can be a challenge. Even when people are still able to work, the stigma against disabled people can be harsh. Physical disabilities do not mean mental deficiencies. Still, the stigma can be difficult to impossible to overcome. For disabled folx who can't work, current SSI disability benefits are [$914/mo for single individuals, $1314 for married individuals](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/how-much-ssi-disability.html). In California, this doesn't even cover the average month's rent. Even with difficult to access Section 8 vouchers, and general relief payments, the hurdles for gaining and maintaining a steady place to live can be too much for some people to climb especially if they have little to no family or social support.

[Locally](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/homelessness-and-climate-crisis), as the heat rises, droughts intensify, and wildfires grow, living on the street will become deadly.
