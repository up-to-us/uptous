<strong>MYTH</strong>: Climate change impacts everyone the same.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: Climate change is a global crisis with global consequences, but it disproportionately affects poor countries and people, and [poor girls and women most of all](https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/womenin-shadow-climate-change). Globally, as this crisis deepens there will be increasing numbers of migrants fleeing desperate situations in their home countries for wealthier countries that are able to insulate themselves from the worst effects.

[Locally](https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/homelessness-and-climate-crisis), as the heat rises, droughts intensify, and wildfires grow, living on the street will become deadly.
