<strong>MYTH</strong>: Climate change impacts everyone the same.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Climate change is a global crisis with global consequences, but it disproportionately affects poor countries and people, and poor girls and women most of all. Globally, as this crisis deepens there will be increasing numbers of migrants fleeing desperate situations in their home countries for wealthier countries that are able to insulate themselves from the worst effects.

Locally, as the heat rises, droughts intensify, and wildfires grow, living on the street will become deadly.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: We must adopt a view of climate change that recognizes the disproportionate effects it has on specific groups, and then devise solutions that center those most affected. At a minimum, we must insist that the city of Los Angeles house all of their residents, because allowing people to live on the street in a climate crisis is flat out immoral. There are many groups focused on the climate crisis and how it impacts the unhoused. But we also need to ensure that our communities are not exploited by irresponsible corporations that have no accountability for their environmental impacts.
