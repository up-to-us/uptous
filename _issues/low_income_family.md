<strong>MYTH</strong>: Unhoused people are at odds with hard working low income families

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Homeless families are low income families. In fact, millions of families across the country are 1-2 paychecks away from falling into houselessness. In 2020 alone, the number of unhoused families in LA increased by 45.7%. That's 45.7% more moms, dads, and kids. The majority of those kids are under 12 years old. The trauma of living on the street at that age will have lasting effects on their abilities to thrive.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: We must stop perpetuating this narrative that unhoused people are all violent, drug addicted, mentally ill men. That obscures a much more complex reality. That's not to say that these things don't contribute to houselessness, they can, but just as often unresolved trauma, poverty, addiction, and mental health issues are made worse by the experience of being unhoused. Families who fall into houselessness do so because they don't have the adequate resources they need to thrive. Sometimes that's because lack of a college degree makes gainful employment hard to find, sometimes it's a sudden debilitating medical issue that creates unsustainable medical debt. Whatever the cause, once people fall into that situation it is exponentially more difficult to get out. Support organizations and proposals that support low income families.
