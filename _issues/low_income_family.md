<strong>MYTH</strong>: Unhoused people are at odds with hard working low income families

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Homeless families are low income families. In fact, millions of families across the country are 1-2 paychecks away from falling into houselessness. In 2020 alone, the number of unhoused families in LA [increased by 45.7%](https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4558-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-presentation.pdf). That's 45.7% more moms, dads, and kids. The majority of those kids are under [12 years old](https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/homeless-children-and-youth). The [trauma](https://www.samhsa.gov/homelessness-programs-resources/hpr-resources/child-homelessness-growing-crisis) of living on the street at that age will have lasting effects on their abilities to thrive.

<strong>HOW TO GET INVOLVED</strong>: We must stop perpetuating this narrative that unhoused people are all violent, drug addicted, mentally ill men. [That obscures a much more complex reality](https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/programs_campaigns/homelessness_programs_resources/hrc-factsheet-current-statistics-prevalence-characteristics-homelessness.pdf). That's not to say that these things don't contribute to houselessness, they can, but just as often unresolved trauma, poverty, addiction, and [mental health issues are made worse by the experience of being unhoused](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/never-ending-loop-homelessness-psychiatric-disorder-and-mortality). Families who fall into houselessness do so because they don't have the adequate resources they need to thrive. Sometimes that's because lack of a college degree makes gainful employment hard to find, sometimes it's a sudden debilitating medical issue that creates unsustainable medical debt. Whatever the cause, [once people fall into that situation it is exponentially more difficult to get out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218240/). Support organizations and proposals that support low income families.
