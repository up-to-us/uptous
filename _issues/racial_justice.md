<strong>MYTH</strong>: I see lots of white homeless people, therefore homelessness has nothing to do with racism.

<strong>RESPONSE</strong>: [Black people make up approximately 8% of LA’s overall population, and 34% of its unhoused population](https://nhslacounty.org/impacting-black-history-black-people-make-up-8-of-l-a-population-and-34-of-its-homeless/). That’s a 475% over-representation compared to their percentage of the population at large. [Every other racial or ethnic group is underrepresented in the relationship to the overall population](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-homeless-los-angeles-2016/). That means black people and communities are bearing the brunt of this crisis on their backs. This has to do with many factors including the [legacy of redlining](https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2019/19-0600_misc_5-6-19.pdf) and other [racist housing policies](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-27/behind-a-new-tv-show-is-the-ugly-and-true-history-of-l-a-s-racist-housing-covenants) draining resources from black communities, leaving them generations behind their white counterparts in building wealth. It has to do with the [blatantly racist drug policies of the 80’s and 90’s](https://apnews.com/article/war-on-drugs-75e61c224de3a394235df80de7d70b70) that left generations of black families traumatized and broken by harsh prison sentences. Still today, [wealthy black teenagers are more likely to wind up in prison than poor white kids](https://eji.org/news/study-rich-black-kids-more-likely-incarcerated-than-poor-white-kids/), and when they do, their wealth is drained by the system, because imprisonment destroys wealth. Study after study has shown that black people in the US experience [toxic stress](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/racism-stress-covid-allostatic-load/) related to their race that has detrimental effects on mental health, physical health, and overall life outcomes more broadly.
