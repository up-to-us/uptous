<strong>MYTH</strong>: I see lots of white homeless people, therefore homelessness has nothing to do with racism.

<strong>TRUTH</strong>: Black people make up approximately 8% of LA’s overall population, and 38% of its unhoused population. That’s a 475% over-representation compared to their percentage of the population at large. Every other racial or ethnic group is underrepresented in the relationship to the overall population. That means black people and communities are bearing the brunt of this crisis on their backs. This has to do with many factors including the legacy of redlining and other racist housing policies draining resources from black communities, leaving them generations behind their white counterparts in building wealth. It has to do with the blatantly racist drug policies of the 80’s and 90’s that left generations of black families traumatized and broken by harsh prison sentences. Still today, wealthy black teenagers are more likely to wind up in prison than poor white male adults, and when they do, their wealth is drained by the system, because imprisonment destroys wealth. Study after study has shown that black people in the US experience toxic stress related to their race that has mental health, physical health, and overall life outcomes more broadly.

<strong>SOLUTION</strong>: We must start advocating for solutions that center the needs of black people experiencing homelessness, because when we focus on addressing their needs from an honest place of truth and transformation we can ensure that everyone will get the help they need. When we focus on the most vulnerable and traumatized, everyone is lifted up. We must be honest about how the legacies of slavery and racism have wrought havoc on black communities in the US. There are many organizations in LA that advocate for the unhoused from a racial justice perspective.

Here are a few:
