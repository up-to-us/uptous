Houselessness can often seem like an intractable, natural part of life. It’s not. The current crisis has been 40+ years in the making. Drug epidemics, erosion of social safety nets, and an increasingly global economy are just three of the many factors that have led to the current epidemic. By breaking it down, and focusing on the various facets of the issue, it becomes easier to fight for and focus on solutions. You do not need to do this alone. Everyone cares about at least one of the issues listed above. Everyone has vulnerable parents whose safety nets have been wiped out by illness; or friends whose lives have been disrupted by divorce or domestic violence; friends or family members touched by the opioid crisis or worse; or maybe they know veterans who have been ravaged by war and PTSD. Everyone on the planet has been touched by climate change. By finding our stake in the solution, and seeing how close to home this issue really is, we can commit to ending houselessness for good, but it’s #UPtoUS.
